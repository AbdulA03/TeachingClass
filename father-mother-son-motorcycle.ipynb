      "MENTOR: That sounds like a great initiative! To ensure it's manageable, let's set a spending limit for initial investments and create a schedule for your business activities. How about dedicating a few hours each week to work on it, with specific goals to achieve each month? We can also set checkpoints to review your progress together.\n",
      "PARENT: I appreciate your enthusiasm for starting an online business, but I'm concerned about the potential distractions it might cause with your studies. How do you plan to balance your time to ensure your academic performance doesn't suffer? Also, can you outline any upfront costs involved and how you intend to manage them within our budget? Perhaps we could consider a trial period to see how it goes.\n",
      "STUDENT: I completely understand your concerns. I plan to allocate specific time slots during the week for my business, ensuring my schoolwork remains my priority. I’ll keep my initial costs low by starting with free platforms and only spending on essential supplies. If my grades start to slip, I’m open to reassessing my commitment and possibly pausing the business. A trial period sounds fair, and I appreciate your support!\n",
      "MENTOR: That’s a solid plan! Let's define the trial period as three months, with a clear focus on maintaining your grades. We can set a budget cap for your initial expenses—how about $100? Additionally, we can establish monthly goals, like launching your website or making your first sale, and check in every two weeks to discuss your progress and any adjustments needed. How does that sound?\n",
      "PARENT: I'm glad to hear you have a plan in place. Just to clarify, what specific academic goals do you have to ensure your grades stay up during this trial period? Also, can you commit to regular check-ins with me to discuss both your business progress and any challenges you might be facing? I want to make sure we’re both on the same page and that you’re not feeling overwhelmed.\n",
      "STUDENT: I can commit to maintaining a minimum GPA and will share my grades with you during our check-ins. I’ll also keep a weekly planner to track both my school assignments and business tasks. Regular check-ins sound great; I can update you every two weeks on my academic performance and business progress. I appreciate your support and guidance in this!\n",
      "MENTOR: Excellent! It sounds like you have a strong plan to balance both your academics and your business. Just to summarize, you'll maintain a minimum GPA, spend no more than $100 on your business, and we’ll check in every two weeks to discuss your progress. This structured approach should help you manage both responsibilities effectively. I'm excited to see how this unfolds for you!\n",
      "PARENT: I’m glad you’re feeling confident about your plan. Just to ensure everything stays manageable, can we agree that if your grades drop below your target, you’ll pause the business until you get back on track? I want to support your entrepreneurial spirit, but your education is the priority. Let’s keep communication open, and I’m here to help if you need anything!\n",
      "STUDENT: That sounds fair, and I completely agree that my education should come first. I’ll make sure to pause the business if my grades drop below my target. I appreciate your support and understanding, and I’ll keep you updated on both my academic and business progress. Thank you for helping me navigate this!\n",
      "PARENT: You're welcome! I'm proud of your initiative and your willingness to prioritize your education. Just remember, if you ever feel overwhelmed, it’s okay to ask for help or adjust your commitments. Let’s keep the lines of communication open, and I’m here to support you every step of the way!\n"
